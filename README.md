I'm 3rd year Software Development student with a keen interest in math, programming, and problem solving in general.

## Skills

- Curious and passionate about software, mathematics and computer science in general. In every school project I did I like to go an extra mile just to add some extra functionality or to improve existing one. I like to say: "Do more - learn more".
- Fast, independent learner. Before started my course at GMIT I read coding book to teach me Java. And it helped me a lot do doing my college.
- Great collaborator. I like to help people. I did Pass course doing my second year in collage. Was main host of GMIT Computing Society form 2016 to 2018.

- Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Procedural Programming
- Java, Java 8+, JavaScript, C, Rust, Python,
- Git



#### Coding

 - **Java/Java 8+:**
     - Currently Java is my language of choice. Learned on my own before collage.
     - I have good understanding of Java Collections API. I can use Streams and Lambdas for most of my coding work. Have no issue to use Java features never used before just by reading documentation. Obviously OOP is not an issue. Please check my Java projects above.

[comment]: # (- Experience, - Achievements, - Evidence)

- **JavaScript:**
    - Is second language of choice. Learned during '17 summer time.
    - Solved most of CodeWars.com problems using it.
    - CodeWars, boucing balls.
- **C:**
    - Is a third language of choice. Have good understanding of it.
    - Did many Arduino little projects. Achieved 86% grade on C module.
    - Project [one](https://github.com/My-/WarGame_C)
    - Project [two](https://github.com/My-/AirportTravelDataLinkList). I went extra mile with it by learning pointers to the functions and implementing class like structures.
    - Created small [testing library](https://github.com/My-/C_BabyTest) to help with 2nd year project.
    - Did some Arduino projects, but sadly all of them was done before collage so none of them survived up to date.
- **Rust:**
    - This language was on my to do list and then for the 3rd year group project we could select any language I suggested to use Rust to building Blockchain. He wasn't mind. So we currently working on this project.
    - Rust is fast - C like speed because it has no garbage collection, safe - instead of garbage collection it use borrowing mechanism and because of that Rust is very complex language.
    - Buy picking new language like Rust for a project I was hoping to prove what to learn new language is not an issue to me.
    - Project can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/My-/year3_project).
- **Python:**
    - Language I was learned over the weekend for the Cisco Jam I did attend in 2017.
    - 3rd year graph theory project to implement [Thomson construction](https://gitlab.com/My-/thompson_construction) algorithm.
- Other: TypeScript, C#;

#### Another Skills

- **Git**
    - I have good understanding of main git commands.
    - I using it for most of my coding.
    - My [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/My-?nav_source=navbar) and [github](https://github.com/My-).

- **Testing**
    - I can write test cases to cover most of my code.
    - I do write test cases for any complicated Java code using Junit5.
    - I do write tests for Rust project.
    - Created small [testing library](https://github.com/My-/C_BabyTest) in C while I was doing C project.

- **Linux**
    - I am using Linux as my main machine for an over year now.
    - Using Linux Mint. I can do most of my needs in terminal with a little help of Google.

- **Docker**
    - I have basic understanding docker.
    - I had chase to play with it for couple days.
