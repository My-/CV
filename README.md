I'm 3rd year Software Development student with a keen interest in math, programming, and problem solving in general.

## Education

    - 77 (year 1)
    - 79.66 (year 2)
    - 81 (year 3 semester 1)
- Projects:

    - [Cosine Distance](https://gitlab.com/My-/cosinedistance)

## Skills

- Curious and passionate about software, mathematics and computer science in general. In every school project I did I like to go an extra mile just to add some extra functionality or to improve existing one. I like to say: "Do more - learn more".
- Fast, independent learner. Before started my course at GMIT I read coding book to teach me Java. And it helped me a lot do doing my college.
- Great collaborator. I like to help people. I did Pass course doing my second year in collage. Was main host of GMIT Computing Society form 2016 to 2018.

- Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Procedural Programming
- Java, Java 8+, JavaScript, C, Rust, Python,
- Git



#### Coding

 - **Java/Java 8+:**
     - Currently Java is my language of choise. Learned on my own before collage.
     - I have good understanding of Java Colletions API. I can use Streams and Lambdas for most of my coding work. Heve no issue to use Java features never used before just by reading documentation. Obviosly OOP is not an issue.

[comment]: # (- Experience, - Achievements, - Evidence)

- **JavaScript:**
    - Is second language of choise. Lerned during '17 summer time.
    - Solved most of CodeWars.com problems using it.
    - CodeWars, boucing balls.
- **C:**
    - Is a third language of choise. Have good undestanding of it.
    - Did many Arduino little projects. Acheived 86% grade on C lang module.
    - 2nd year project, Created small testing library to help with 2nd year project. Sadly Arduino projects was done before collage and none of them survived up to date.
- **Rust:**
    - This language was on my to do list and then for the 3rd year group project we could select any language I suggested to use Rust to building Blockchain. He wasn't mind. So we currently working on this project.
    - Rust is fast - C like speed because it has no garbage collection, safe - instead of garbage collection it use borrowing mechanism and because of that Rust is very complex language.
    - Buy picking new language like Rust for a project I was hoping to prove what to learn new language is not an issue to me.

- **Python:**
    - Language I was learned over the weekend for the Cisco Jam I did attend in 2017.
    - 3rd year graph theory project [Link to the project here]
- Other: TypeScript, C#;

#### Another Skills

- **Git**
    - I have good understaning of main git commands.
    - I using it for most of my coding.
    - [Links to My git pages: github & gitlab]

- **Testing**
    - I can write test cases to cover most of my code.
    - I do write test cases for any complicated Java code using Junit5.
    - I do write tests for Rust project.
    - Created small testing library in C while I was doing C project.
    - [Links to projects with tests, my BabyTest library]

- **Linux**
    - I am using Linux as my main mashine for an over year now.
    - Using Linux Mint. Can do most of my needs in terminal with a little help of Google.

- **Docker**
    - I have basic understanding docker.
    - I had chanse to play with it for couple days.
